# SensorMimicker
Microwave sensor modbus on TCP/IP data transferring imitator.
Sensor measure humidity of probe and estimate some parameters will be read by master system.
The data transferring by RS485 line and modified MODBUS RTU protocol is used.
RS485 data packet framed into TCP/IP fields and transferred between systems by Ethernet or WiFi network.

Our app simulate real sensor PCB by software.
